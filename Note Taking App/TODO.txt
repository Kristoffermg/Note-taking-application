HIGH PRIORITY:
	1. (DONE) Separate the creation of new notes between header and child notes
	2. Make settings page
	3. Make a new SQL account that only manages CRUD operations and use it in the connection string
	4. Store connection string in App.config and run "git update-index --assume-unchanged App.config" to stop Git from monitoring changes to the App.config file



MID PRIORITY:
	1. Only change cursor for Datagrid when hovering over a cell 
	2. (DONE) Mark the current child note that is displayed 
	3. Not allowing duplicate note names
	4. Give graphics to buttons



LOW PRIORITY:
	1. Find another way to edit a cells name, so that you dont have to double click the header notes to open them, rather than single click
	3. Add a user based environment, where the notes are individual to each user
