HIGH PRIORITY:
	1. (DONE) Separate the creation of new notes between header and child notes
	2. Make settings page
	3. (DONE) Make a new SQL account that only manages CRUD operations and use it in the connection string
	4. (DONE) Store connection string in App.config and run "git update-index --assume-unchanged App.config" to stop Git from monitoring changes to the App.config file
	5. Automatically resize controls (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTsyUclt-XU)
	6. Apply unit testing to the project (need to practice TDD!)



MID PRIORITY:
	1. Only change cursor for Datagrid when hovering over a cell 
	2. (DONE) Mark the current child note that is displayed 
	3. Not allowing duplicate note names
	4. (DONE) Save the current note when closing the app, as well as the height and width of the app
	5. Ability to delete notes, with a warning before it actually deletes (or perhaps it is still saved in db, but has a flag?)



LOW PRIORITY:
	1. Find another way to edit a cells name, so that you dont have to double click the header notes to open them, rather than single click
