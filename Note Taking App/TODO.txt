HIGH PRIORITY:
	1. Separate the creation of new notes between header and child notes



MID PRIORITY:
	1. Only change cursor for Datagrid when hovering over a cell 
	2. Mark the current child note that is displayed 
	3. Not allowing duplicate note names



LOW PRIORITY:
	1. Find another way to edit a cells name, so that you dont have to double click the header notes to open them, rather than single click
